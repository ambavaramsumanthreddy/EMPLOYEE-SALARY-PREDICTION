# EMPLOYEE-SALARY-PREDICTION
About This project aims to predict whether an employee’s income exceeds ₹50K or not, based on various features such as age, education, occupation, work hours, and more. Using machine learning classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the system analyzes patterns in employee data to make accurate predictions. The project includes data cleaning, feature encoding, model training, and deployment through a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.
